Feedback from reddit post:
-Add a way to view SRD creatures and copy them into your own bestiaries (see below - this was already planned)
-Different views for viewing bestiary? maybe a way to increase font size on a/all stat blocks, and a way to switch to landscape mode
-UI is not working correctly on Chrome or Safari on iOS.

-Damage type seems to not be working on generate attack for ranged weapons (like Hand Crossbow, Longbow, etc.).
-Autofill special abilities for races as well


-Fill in CreatureData.senses (Darkvision 60ft., Darkvision 30ft., Tremorsense 60ft. etc);
-Ability to copy creatures from one bestiary to another. One way would be as a copy/paste where multiple creatures could be on your clipboard at once. The 'paste' button would appear on inner header if 1 or more creatures are on your clipboard. Have some way to clear your clipboard and to indicate what is on your clipboard (or at least how many creatures are on it).
-Public Bestiaries (at least add public domain creature stat blocks somehow so that people can jump right in and use it)
-Fix the slowdown when there are many creatures. This is caused because there are so many things being added to the DOM. One possible fix is to use the 'mini' stat block size and give users a smart way to expand them.

-Filter button on view bestiary should be highlighted or show a little red number or something if filters are active but it is closed.
-Ability to remove name filters (maybe name filters should be chips?)
-Reset password is not scaled appropriately on small screens (like phones)
-Cross-browser - columns don't work on firefox, IE is totally untested.

- Add autofill for abilities based on the ability name and abilities in the monster manual.
- Add a 'CR Calculator' helper based on avg damage etc (check that this stuff is in the basic rules though)
- Add 'hints' under the fields (see 'Errors Advanced' section of angular material Input demo)


LONG TERM
- Encounters with a bunch of notes and linked creatures
- The ability to do auto-initiative for an encounter as well as rolling attacks + damage for creatures
- Link encounters and creatures to each other and to locations
