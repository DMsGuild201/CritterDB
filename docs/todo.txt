+Add description to Bestiary

- ADD TOKEN AUTHORIZATION FOR USERS: https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens

-Add tooltips to everything
-Add Users
-Add Bestiary list for users

-Figure out how to make textareas auto expand

- Add Attack ability type in addition to actions (which has To Hit, damage die number and size, # of multiattacks if any, bonus to damage)
- Make Racial stats auto-fill if a standard race is chosen (size, speed, senses, languages)
- Make Armor Class auto-fill if a standard auto-type is chosen (need to calculate based on dex as well)
- Add a 'CR Calculator' helper based on avg damage etc (check that this stuff is in the basic rules though)
- Add an 'Add Action Wizard' button with modal/whatever to the Actions field on front end. This should let you put in an attack name, damage dice, whether it is finesse or not, reach, and number of targets. Alternatively it will suggest some common weapons and autofill the other values.
- Add an 'Add Speed Wizard' button that will add a move type with a value (step=5 in feet)
- Add 'hints' under the fields (see 'Errors Advanced' section of angular material Input demo)


LONG TERM
- Encounters with a bunch of notes and linked creatures
- The ability to do auto-initiative for an encounter as well as rolling attacks + damage for creatures
