-Mobile/Tablets
	- Header should have a button to open a sidenav with account options rather than displaying username (or just a 'head' icon instead of username, to make things simpler)
	- Top of 'body-area' should be higher to account for smaller toolbar headers
	- Login/Signup should take up the full body area
	- Icons on toolbar in bestiary view are being squashed
	- Limited text space on inner-header results in multi-line 'My Bestiaries > Current Bestiary > Current Creature'. This may not be a huge deal?
	- Having no ability to hover results in odd UX to access modify creature icons (like edit, copy, delete). Maybe have a button that is always visible on each stat block?
	- Not enough room on create/edit creature page. Rather than side by side there should be a button to toggle the stat-block taking up the full body area, or being totally hidden.


-Figure out how to make textareas auto expand (like the Bestiary description in the edit panel)

-Public Bestiaries (at least add public domain creature stat blocks somehow so that people can jump right in and use it)
-Ability to copy creatures from one bestiary to another
-Cross-browser

- Add Attack ability type in addition to actions (which has To Hit, damage die number and size, # of multiattacks if any, bonus to damage). This can auto-fill if you select a common weapon type.
- Make Racial stats auto-fill if a standard race is chosen (size, speed, senses, languages)
- Make Armor Class auto-fill if a standard auto-type is chosen (need to calculate based on dex as well)
- Add a 'CR Calculator' helper based on avg damage etc (check that this stuff is in the basic rules though)
- Add an 'Add Action Wizard' button with modal/whatever to the Actions field on front end. This should let you put in an attack name, damage dice, whether it is finesse or not, reach, and number of targets. Alternatively it will suggest some common weapons and autofill the other values.
- Add 'hints' under the fields (see 'Errors Advanced' section of angular material Input demo)


LONG TERM
- Encounters with a bunch of notes and linked creatures
- The ability to do auto-initiative for an encounter as well as rolling attacks + damage for creatures
- Link encounters and creatures to each other and to locations
