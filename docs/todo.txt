-Ability to copy creatures from one bestiary to another. One way would be as a copy/paste where multiple creatures could be on your clipboard at once. The 'paste' button would appear on inner header if 1 or more creatures are on your clipboard. Have some way to clear your clipboard and to indicate what is on your clipboard (or at least how many creatures are on it).
-Public Bestiaries (at least add public domain creature stat blocks somehow so that people can jump right in and use it)

-Cross-browser

- Make Armor Class auto-fill if a standard auto-type is chosen (need to calculate based on dex as well)
- Add Attack ability type in addition to actions (which has To Hit, damage die number and size, # of multiattacks if any, bonus to damage). This can auto-fill if you select a common weapon type.
- Add a 'CR Calculator' helper based on avg damage etc (check that this stuff is in the basic rules though)
- Add an 'Add Action Wizard' button with modal/whatever to the Actions field on front end. This should let you put in an attack name, damage dice, whether it is finesse or not, reach, and number of targets. Alternatively it will suggest some common weapons and autofill the other values.
- Add 'hints' under the fields (see 'Errors Advanced' section of angular material Input demo)


LONG TERM
- Encounters with a bunch of notes and linked creatures
- The ability to do auto-initiative for an encounter as well as rolling attacks + damage for creatures
- Link encounters and creatures to each other and to locations
