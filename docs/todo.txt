Important/Current:

-BUG: If you create a new creature then click back on the bestiary name in the toolbar, the new creature doesn't show in the bestiary list. UPDATE: This happens because the creature hasn't actually saved before going back to the previous page.
-Automate database backups somehow (at least make a batch file)
-Bug: Critter icon in title starts down, goes up, then goes back down
-Add option to include/exclude description when saving critter as image.
-Add option to set overall font size when saving critter as image
-Print bestiary functionality
-Add functionality to share a critter
-Smarter selection of popular bestiaries - have it based on age in some way. At the simplest level you could just exclude bestiaries older than a month. More complex would be to base it on some combination of factors (age, # of likes).
-Notifications when someone has commented, liked, etc your bestiaries, or tagged you in a comment.
-Upgrade to more robust database service
-About page
-UI is not working correctly on Chrome or Safari on iOS.
-Bug: Sometimes when in the create/edit creature page the current bestiary is not shown on the inner header so it is difficult/confusing to go back to it. UPDATE: This happens when using 'Save & Continue', probably because it overrides current creature who no longer has 'creature.bestiary.name' field.

-Autofill special abilities for races as well
-Maybe alignment should be an autofill not a select?

-Fill in CreatureData.senses (Darkvision 60ft., Darkvision 30ft., Tremorsense 60ft. etc);
-Public Bestiaries (at least add public domain creature stat blocks somehow so that people can jump right in and use it)

-Cross-browser - columns don't work on firefox, IE is totally untested.

- Add a 'CR Calculator' helper based on avg damage etc (check that this stuff is in the basic rules though)
- Add 'hints' under the fields (see 'Errors Advanced' section of angular material Input demo)


LONG TERM
- Encounters with a bunch of notes and linked creatures
- The ability to do auto-initiative for an encounter as well as rolling attacks + damage for creatures
- Link encounters and creatures to each other and to locations
