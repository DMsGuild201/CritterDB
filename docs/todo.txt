Important/Current:
- Implement public bestiaries
	+ Front end route to view lists of popular/recent/etc published bestiaries
	+ Back & front end routes to show a specific user's published bestiaries, along with links to that user in published bestiary view and list pages.
	+ Should go Published Bestiaries > TYPE > Bestiary Name if possible
	+ Home page front end showing bestiary of the week, recent published bestiaries, etc
	+ Add ability to create/delete/update 'Comments' to back end
	+ Add comments to front end for published bestiaries
	+ Security determining when you can edit a bestiary and when you can view it
	+ SRD bestiary

-Bug: Challenge Rating step amount is always set to 1/8 at first, even if the value isn't starting at 1/8.
-Add option to include/exclude description when saving critter as image.
-Print bestiary functionality
-Smarter selection of popular bestiaries - have it based on age in some way. At the simplest level you could just exclude bestiaries older than a month. More complex would be to base it on some combination of factors (age, # of likes).
-Notifications when someone has commented, liked, etc your bestiaries, or tagged you in a comment.
-Upgrade to more robust database service
-About page
-UI is not working correctly on Chrome or Safari on iOS.
-Bug: Sometimes when in the create/edit creature page the current bestiary is not shown on the inner header so it is difficult/confusing to go back to it

-Autofill special abilities for races as well
-Maybe alignment should be an autofill not a select?

-Fill in CreatureData.senses (Darkvision 60ft., Darkvision 30ft., Tremorsense 60ft. etc);
-Public Bestiaries (at least add public domain creature stat blocks somehow so that people can jump right in and use it)
-Fix the slowdown when there are many creatures. This is caused because there are so many things being added to the DOM. One possible fix is to use the 'mini' stat block size and give users a smart way to expand them.

-Cross-browser - columns don't work on firefox, IE is totally untested.

- Add a 'CR Calculator' helper based on avg damage etc (check that this stuff is in the basic rules though)
- Add 'hints' under the fields (see 'Errors Advanced' section of angular material Input demo)


LONG TERM
- Encounters with a bunch of notes and linked creatures
- The ability to do auto-initiative for an encounter as well as rolling attacks + damage for creatures
- Link encounters and creatures to each other and to locations
